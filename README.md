# Boilerplate with PHP MVC & Gulp features

> IAMDEVLOPR is an extenstion on the [Thane](https://github.com/thibmaek/Thane) boilerplate from [thibmaek](https://github.com/thibmaek). If you're a student "Devine" at Howest Kortrijk, Belgium, this boilerplate is perfect for starting new assignments. If not, it's still very useful and easy to start new web projects.



## Quickstart

- This is the barebones version of this repo's master branch. It just includes the base MVC 'framework' from #devinehowest's BAD (Backend) course. You can just start working in the folders right away with your PHP server (MAMP, Vagrant, Otto, etc) running this repo as http root.
- Additionally Gulp is available if you like to write SCSS instead of plain CSS. You could also just write plain CSS in a css folder in the project root.
