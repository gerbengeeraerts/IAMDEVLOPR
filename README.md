# Boilerplate with PHP MVC & Gulp features
>IAMDEVLOPR is an extenstion on the [Thane](https://github.com/thibmaek/Thane) boilerplate from [thibmaek](https://github.com/thibmaek). If you're a student "Devine" at Howest Kortrijk, Belgium, this boilerplate is perfect for starting new assignments. If not, it's still very usefull and easy to start new web projects.

## Quickstart
* Make sure you have [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) installed on your machine and run the `Gulp.command` file. This will auto-install the needed packages which are described in `packages.json` and automatically will start the Gulp watch task.
* Add your database connection in dao/dao.php
