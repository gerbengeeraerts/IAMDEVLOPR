# Boilerplate with PHP MVC & Gulp features
> IAMDEVLOPR is an extenstion on the [Thane](https://github.com/thibmaek/Thane) boilerplate from [thibmaek](https://github.com/thibmaek). If you're a student "Devine" at Howest Kortrijk, Belgium, this boilerplate is perfect for starting new assignments. If not, it's still very useful and easy to start new web projects.


## Quickstart
* Make sure you have [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) installed on your machine and run the `Gulp.command` file. This will auto-install the needed packages which are described in `package.json` and automatically will start the Gulp watch task.
* Install [Bower](http://bower.io) and run `bower install` to install client side dependencies. (Located in *js/vendor*)
* Add your database connection in dao/dao.php
* When finished on your project upload the `deploy` folder to the server. This contains all the minified and generated files you need for the web.
